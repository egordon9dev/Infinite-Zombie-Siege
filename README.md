# Zombie-Siege
This is a big, on-going project of a 2d game. It involves virtually infinite procedurally generated terrain using 2D simplex noise. Besides that, it involves shooting stuff and killing zombies. This is currently my main project (as of Feb. 11, 2017) and will be continue to be updated until I run out of ideas. I have currently only put about 25 hours into this game, so that might explain the lack of extra features.

recent additions:
- start menu
- the ability to score points
