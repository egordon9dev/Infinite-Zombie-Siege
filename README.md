# Infinite-Zombie-Siege
This is a large, on-going project of a 2d game. It involves infinite terrain generation using 2D simplex noise. Besides that, it involves shooting stuff and killing zombies. This is currently my main project (as of Feb. 11, 2017) and will be continue to be updated until I run out of ideas.
